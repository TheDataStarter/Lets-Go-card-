# Lets-Go-card-
A collection of R code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) used in a DATA7001 assignment for the University of Queensland's Master of Data Science coursework.

_Employ a design thinking-led, data science workflow (involving R, Python, Tableau and ArcGIS) to gather, transform and enrich available data (published as open data by the Queensland Government and Australian Bureau of Statistics). Use of descriptive (aggregation) and diagnostic (clustering, regression) analytics to discover new relationships between features of users of public transport in South East Queensland at both macro and micro scale._

# Jupyter notebooks showing EDA
Hypothesis - Public Transport serves productive commuters - [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20serves%20productive%20commuters.ipynb) or [HTML File.](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20serves%20productive%20commuters.html)

Hypothesis - More Lower SE People use Public Transport than High SE - [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20more%20low-SE%20people%20use%20public%20transport%20than%20high-SE.ipynb) or [HTML File.](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20more%20low-SE%20people%20use%20public%20transport%20than%20high-SE.html)

Hypothesis - Public Transport serves people who live in that area - [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20serves%20people%20who%20live%20in%20that%20area.ipynb) or [HTML File.](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20serves%20people%20who%20live%20in%20that%20area.html)

Hypothesis - Public Transport serves people of relative wealth - [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20serves%20people%20of%20relative%20wealth.ipynb) or [HTML File.](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20serves%20people%20of%20relative%20wealth.html)

Hypothesis - Public Transport is as easily accessible to people without cars - [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20is%20easily%20accessible%20to%20people%20without%20cars.ipynb) or [HTML File.](https://github.com/TheDataStarter/Lets-Go-card-/blob/master/Jupyter/Dave%20-%20PT%20is%20easily%20accessible%20to%20people%20without%20cars.html)
